# public-images

## What's this?
Personal image hosting project, use for saving images for markdown files that can be publicly seen.

Some images in [my blog](https://mikelyou.com)'s posts will be saved here.

## What you can do with this?
When you cite or reproduce my posts on my blog, you can cite or reproduce corresponding images.

Images inside folders with the name of posts will be relatively stable, but I cannot promise they will never be renamed, moved, or edited someday.

## What you cannot do with this?
You cannot use any images that are not part of my posts on my blog in any method, which includes but not limited to quoting, reproducing, copying, and editing.

You cannot fork this repository.
